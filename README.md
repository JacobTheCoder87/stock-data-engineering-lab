## Project Description
In this project, I used a validation script to check if my data analysis pipeline code working as intended. Our goal for this project is to calculate the average, median, and standard deviation of Amazon's stock prices over 9 weeks. The raw data was provided to us in the 'amzn.csv' file. This project requires us to have a solid understanding of for loops and control structures in Python. We had to clean our data by removing any extra spaces and unnecessary information, such as dates. Then creating new lists and appending the clean data into that list. Finally, using the stats module that we imported, we calculated our median and standard deviation. Everything was verified through the validation script created to test if our code is running correctly. Some challenges I faced in this project include creating nested for loops.
